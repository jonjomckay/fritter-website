<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-6">Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-2 mt-4">TLDR;</h3>

<p>No data is collected by Fritter, unless you submit a crash dump, or manually send a "Hello" ping in the app.
    Interaction with Twitter is minimised, but you still need to agree to their <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy"
        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy policy.</a></p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-2 mt-4">Declaration</h3>

<p>Fritter <i>does not</i>, and will never, collect user data unless voluntarily submitted by the user.</p>

<p>Fritter <i>does not</i>, and will never, share user data with any third-party, except data submitted by users in
    requests to Twitter (e.g. searching for a hashtag), or unless that data has voluntarily been submitted (e.g.
    uploading a crash dump).</p>

<p>Fritter <i>does not</i>, and will never, contain features that rely on monetisation. Donations and sponsorship,
    however, are accepted, but will not provide app-changing perks to those donators/sponsors.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-2 mt-4">Third Party</h3>

<p>Although non-anonymous interaction with Twitter is minimised:</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-0">
    <li>Fritter will request content that you explicitly want to be displayed. For example, if you want to view a tweet,
        it is requested directly from Twitter</li>
    <li>No personal details (such as phone details, call logs or contacts) are sent to Twitter</li>
    <li>However, since we do send requests directly to Twitter, your usage of Fritter still relies upon your acceptance
        of Twitter's <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy
            policy</a></li>
</ul>
